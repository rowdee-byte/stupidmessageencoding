# stupidmessageencoding
A stupid project I made to share messages that are 'encrypted.'
Wrote in python 3.7 on linux. No external modules are required. 
# How it works.
It's basically a Caeser Cipher, with a little bit of a twist. It adds or subtracts a value (Key Number) from a characters ASCII number. Whether it adds or subtracts is based on a pseudorandom number generator. This means that it is very rare for a 'PassKey' to be the same - even if the Message and Key Number are the same.
# Is it secure?
No.
# Can it be bruteforced?
Yes.
# Then why did you make it?
Cause it was a bit of fun.
